This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
Hi this is my Naperville yelp coding challenge. 

In order to run this application first you need to clone this repo to your computer. 

### `git clone https://github.com/Bhuang23/Yelp-app.git`

Then go into the Yelp-app directory 

### `cd Yelp-app`

Then, start the backend server called yelpbackend and then the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```



Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
